# Applied-Data-Science--1
Assignment-1 Statistics and Trends

**Overview**

This project provides an in-depth analysis of trends and insights in the mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset, focusing on key factors such as Device Model, operating systems, Battery Drain, Data Usage, and User Behaviour Class. Using Python and Jupyter Notebook, we explore statistical relationships and patterns within the data to derive actionable insights.

**Dataset**

File: /kaggle/input/mobile-device-usage-and-user-behavior-dataset Includes fields such as Device Model, Operating systems, Data Usage, and User Behaviour Class providing a rich basis for analysis.

**Workflow**

Data Loading & Cleaning Prepare the dataset for analysis by handling missing values, transforming data types, and filtering relevant entries. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Conduct initial exploration of data distributions and correlations across fields. Statistical Analysis Analyze statistical trends to examine potential relationships among variables. Visualization Use data visualization techniques to illustrate insights, including histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

**Key Findings**

This analysis reveals key trends, correlations, and insights derived from the data. These may include patterns related to socioeconomic factors, enabling a better understanding of demographic influences on health. Usage Run Analysis Open statistics and trends. ipynb in Jupyter Notebook and run each cell to reproduce the analysis.
